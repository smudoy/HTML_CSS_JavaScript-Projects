# HTML_CSS_JavaScript-Projects
This repository is a collection of all the front-end projects I have worked on, modified, and made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's intended for:

Documenting my coding journey

Showcasing a portfolio of projects

Demonstrating front-end fundamentals for learning and sharing

Each project is self-contained, easy to run in a browser, and reflects my progress and experiments over time.
